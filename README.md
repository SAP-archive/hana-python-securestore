# hana-python-securestore
Multi-Target Application Python example of interfacing with the HANA Secure Store API

## Description

This repo contains a complete example of interfacing with the SAP HANA Secure Store API.  It take the form of multi-target application(MTA) with the interfacing module written in the python programming language.  

If you are just interested in the python specifics of calling the API, you can find all the details in the [python/server.py](python/server.py) file.

This example is referred to in the official SAP help documentation at the following link: [Access the SAP HANA Secure Store with Python](https://help.sap.com/viewer/DRAFT/4505d0bdaf4948449b7f7379d24d0f0d/2.0.04/en-US/0d07ee1462c141beb8a86a92bc9cb92e.html)

## Requirements

The Secure Store functions are implmented in a SAP HANA Database instance and the sample application must be deployed to a space where the HANA instance is available.

* The target deploy environment must have Python runtime 3.6.5 installed(or adjust python/runtime.txt).  Verify with the following.
    ```
    xs runtimes
    ```

    If the required Python runtime is not available, request it be installed by your HANA system administrator. Please refer the administrator to the following help files:  [The SAP HANA XS Advanced Python Run Time](https://help.sap.com/viewer/DRAFT/4505d0bdaf4948449b7f7379d24d0f0d/2.0.03/en-US/8d786ec8ab964145a7453c1f53f452db.html)

* The [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/), which should also install *pip*.

* Either the XSA command-line-interface tools or the CF command-line-interface tool with MTA plugin to facilitate the deploy.  This example will use the XSA CLI. See the [Client package available from the HANA Express Downloader](https://www.sap.com/cmp/ft/crm-xu16-dat-hddedft/index.html) or the [CF CLI + MTA Plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin)

A functional java runtime(for the MTA builder tool).  See [Java.COM](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

The MTA builder tool jar file.  See [Multitarget Application Archive Builder](https://help.sap.com/viewer/58746c584026430a890170ac4d87d03b/Cloud/en-US/ba7dd5a47b7a4858a652d15f9673c28d.html) 

A functional NodeJS implementation with NPM utility for assembling the nodejs dependencies. See [NodeJS.ORG](https://nodejs.org/en/)

This example project also requires python libraries provided by SAP to users with authorized access to download SAP software.

Note: There is an current effort to make these libraries publically available.  See the To-Do section below.

Once installed or vendored, the following python libraries are provided to the python module of the application.

- cfenv
- sap_py_jwt
- sap_xssec
- hdbcli

## Download and Installation

Follow the help instructions at the following link in order to download the XS_PYTHON.ZIP file.

[Download and Consume Python Libraries](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4505d0bdaf4948449b7f7379d24d0f0d/2.0.03/en-US/842824f04d654ceeaf5168da663a65ce.html)

Note: The following should be performed on a Linux system.  The python pip utility has a tendency to pick up versions of the libraries of the current system's architecture and this will cause the deployed application to crash.

Create a folder (using sap_dependencies here to mimik the help documentation) and unzip the file contents into it.
The file name was XS_PYTHON00_1-70003433.ZIP as of the date this repo was last updated.  You may need to adjust the filename.

```
mkdir -p sap_dependencies
unzip XS_PYTHON00_1-70003433.ZIP -d sap_dependencies
```

Clone this repo at the same directory level as the sap_dependencies folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/SAP/hana-python-securestore.git
```

Change into the project folder.
```
cd hana-python-securestore
```

If pip doesn't support the download sub-command you may need to update it.
```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Pull all the python dependencies into a "vendor" folder that will be bundled into the project.
```
cd python
mkdir -p vendor
pip download -d vendor -r requirements.txt --find-links ../../sap_dependencies
cd ..
```

Pull all the NodeJS dependencies into a "node_modules" folder that will be bundled into the project.
```
tools/set_nodejs_env
cd app
npm install
cd ..
```

Build the MTAR and deploy the application to a space where an SAP HANA instance is available.
```
mkdir -p target
java -jar ../mta_archive_builder-1.1.7.jar --build-target XSA --mtar target/python-securestore_xsa.mtar build
xs deploy target/python-securestore_xsa.mtar --use-namespaces
```

Discover the deployed application's URL and open it in a browser.
```
xs app hana-python-securestore.app --urls
```

## Configuration

This example contains no configuration options.

## Limitations

This example is intended to illustrate the use of the Secure Storage API in a HANA system.  It does not contain extensive error handling or enforce a certain order of operations.  As such, certain assumptions apply and key values are hard coded.  For instance, you can not retrieve or delete a value before it's been created.

## Known Issues

This example contains no known issues and is provided "as-is".

## How to obtain support

This project is provided "as-is" with no expectation for major changes or support.

You may attempt to contact the original author [Andrew Lunde](mailto:andrew.lunde@sap.com) if you find errors in this document.

## Contributing

This project is provided "as-is" and is not accepting contributors.

## To-Do (upcoming changes)

The required python libraries may become publically available on PyPi at some point in the future.  If this becomes the case, the requirements will be simplified to remove the downloading of the SAP Python Libraries.
